## Bellman-Ford Algorithm
A weighted network can have edges with negative weights, but the Bellman-Ford method, a dynamic programming technique, can still identify the shortest path between a source node and all other nodes in the graph. In order to find the best solution, the algorithm iteratively relaxes the graph's edges.
## BFS algorithm
 Breadth-First Search algorithm used to traverse or search a graph or tree data structure. It starts at the root node and explores all the neighbor nodes at the current depth before moving on to the next depth level. The algorithm uses a queue to store the nodes that need to be visited.
